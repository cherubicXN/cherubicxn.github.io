abstract = "Junctions play an important role in characterizing local geometrical structures of images, and the             detection of which is a longstanding but challenging task. Existing junction detectors usually focus on             identifying the location and orientations of junction branches while ignoring their scales which however             contain rich geometries of images. This paper presents a novel approach for junction detection and             characterization, which especially exploits the locally anisotropic geometries of a junction and estimates             its scales by relying on an a-contrario model. The output junctions are with anisotropic scales, saying             that a scale parameter is associated with each branch of a junction, and are thus named as anisotropicscale             junctions (ASJs). We then apply the new detected ASJs for matching indoor images, where there             are dramatic changes of viewpoints and the detected local visual features, e.g. key-points, are usually             insufficient and lack distinctive ability. We propose to use the anisotropic geometries of our junctions             to improve the matching precision of indoor images. The matching results on sets of indoor images             demonstrate that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on indoor image matching."
