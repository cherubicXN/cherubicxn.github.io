# Short Bio
I am a PhD candidate in Wuhan University majoring 3D computer vision under the supervision with Prof. [Liangpei Zhang](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/prof_web/zhangliangpei/rs/index.html) and [Gui-Song Xia](https://captain.whu.edu.cn/xia.html) in the [CAPTAIN group](https://captain.whu.edu.cn) of the LIESMARS (State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing) at Wuhan University.

 <!-- Before starting my PhD, I received a Bachelor degree in Computational Mathematics at Wuhan University in Jun. 2014. From Sep. 2014 to Jun. 2016, I have worked as a master student in LIESMARS with Prof. Gui-Song Xia on structure-from-motion (SfM) and visual correspondence. Currently, I’m continuing my studying toward a Ph.D degree in 3D reconstruction. -->
